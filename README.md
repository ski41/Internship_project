# Internship_project
This project allows us to use find the thickness of CAD objects (.stl format) using python with trimesh. This is a part of python automation to see if a particular 3D printing material (here PLA) is able to 3D print or not

"printable_or_not.py" uses the in-built trimesh method to calculate the thickness.

Change the path to your folder containing your Models to be reviewed.
